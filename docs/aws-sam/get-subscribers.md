You are starting to build the main project. The relevant code samples are found under `aws-sam-src`. I recommend building the code step by step, following the instructions. However, I've also included the source code for each chapter in case you don't want to build from scratch.

## Architecture

The "Get Subscribers" function returns a list of all email addresses that have subscribed to a specific mailing list.

![get-subscribers](https://github.com/fun-with-serverless/building-serverless-using-iac/assets/110536677/2a6c83f7-8988-4e32-9bae-cd69d6fc3843)

## Implementation
* Delete the CF stack created by the sample app you've created by running `sam delete`. Next, you can delete the `sam-app` folder created by `sam init`. 
* Go to `aws-sam-src/start-here-step1`
* You should see a basic structure of our SAM aplication for managing user groups.
* Add `boto3==1.21.37` to `get_subscribers/requirements.txt`
* Paste

1. Define how long a Lambda can run before receiving a timeout event. This can be set per Lambda function, or, as in our case, defined globally.
2. Environment variables are useful for defining static configurations.
3. Specify the security permissions for the Lambda, adhering to the principle of Least Privilege.
4. Define a path parameter.
5. Create a new DynamoDB table. If you're curious about the properties available for each resource type, a quick Google search will likely lead you to the official AWS documentation.
6. Define the DynamoDB attributes that make up your schema.
7. Specify the schema, which includes a hash key and a range key.
8. Add variables to your output to make it usable.

into `template.yaml`


* Paste 

``` { .py .annotate }
import json
import os
import boto3
from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key


# Cache client
session = boto3.Session()
dynamodb = session.resource("dynamodb")
SUBSCRIBERS_TABLE = os.environ.get("SUBSCRIBERS_TABLE")
table = dynamodb.Table(SUBSCRIBERS_TABLE)
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get group name
    group = event.get("pathParameters", {}).get("group") #(1)!
    if group:
        response = table.query(
            KeyConditionExpression=Key('group_name').eq(group) #(2)!
        )
        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": json.dumps(response['Items']),
        }
    else:
        return {
            "statusCode": 500, 
            "body": "Missing group!",
        }
```

1. The Lambda event contains all the details from the API Gateway call, including path parameters, query parameters, headers, and more. You can learn about the event content in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html).
2. This is a range query that returns a list.

into `app.py`

* Build and deploy `sam build`
* `sam deploy --guided`. Use `user-groups` as stack name

### Add a new group with subscribers
* Use the DynamoDB console to add a new group with multiple subscribers
* Make an API call and get back results

## Insights

### Hard coding resource names
Avoid hardcoding resource names into your code. Resource names have a tendency to change quite frequently, especially if you are following best practices such as using a unique prefix for each environment.

In AWS SAM, you can easily retrieve resource names using `!Ref` or `!GetAtt logicalNameOfResource.attributeName`. Each CloudFormation resource type documentation includes a 'Return Value' section, which can guide you on which CloudFormation function to use.

You can pass the resource name as an environment variable into Lambda and easily retrieve it via code. In the above code snippet, we are passing the table name using the `SUBSCRIBERS_TABLE` environment variable and retrieving it using `os.environ.get("SUBSCRIBERS_TABLE")`.

### Session managment and Caching
Sessions can be used to isolate resources and clients from each other, which can help to prevent accidental access to another session's resources. This is particularly useful when you want to use a different set of AWS credentials or when you want to ensure that the resources and clients of one part of your code do not accidentally have access to another part's resources. Creating a new session does not establish a new connection to AWS. Instead, it helps manage AWS credentials and configurations and allows Boto3 to more efficiently reuse connections, so the second time this Lambda container is called, it can reuse a previous connection.

### DDB structure
We are structuring our DynamoDB table based on the queries we intend to use. Currently, we expect to retrieve all subscribers for a specific group, so we are defining the group name as the primary key. This is achieved by setting `group_name` as `HASH` in the AWS SAM definition of the table.

### Principle of Least Priviliged Access
> Every module (such as a process, a user, or a program, depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.

Our Lambda function only requires ReadOnly access to the DynamoDB table we created. You can define permissions by adding a `Policies` attribute. AWS SAM includes a list of predefined policies that you can use, which can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-template-list.html#dynamo-db-read-policy). Each policy typically accepts a parameter that specifies the resource to which the policy is applied. In our case, the parameter is `TableName`.

### API Gateway integration
One of the benefits of AWS SAM is its ease of event-based integration with additional AWS services like SQS, SNS, API Gateway, etc. To add event integration, all you need to do is add an `Event` attribute with the relevant configuration.

In our case, we are integrating with API Gateway. We define the base URL path using curly braces, like `/{group}/subscribers`. This means that whenever an external client accesses the API, it needs to supply the group it wants to pull. The integration here is proxy-based, so all paths and headers are passed directly to the Lambda function as part of the event variable. You can easily retrieve the path parameter by using `event.get("pathParameters", {}).get("group")` in the code.

## Exercises
* Remove the policy from the Lambda definition. Try invoking the Lambda. What happens, and why?
??? tip
    1. Use AWS CloudWatch to debug your Lambda function.
    2. Type "CloudWatch" in the search bar, then go to "Logs" -> "Log Groups" and search for your Lambda function by name.
* Improve the response JSON by adding an attribute that contains the number of items, in addition to the list itself.
* Add the DynamoDB table name to the `Output` section of the `template.yaml` file.
??? tip
    1. Look at the Return values section in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html
    2. Use `!Ref` or `!Sub` to pull the value.
